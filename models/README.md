# Models Directory

This directory stores trained ML model files (`.pkl`) generated by INLAAS.

## Files Created Automatically

| File | Created by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `log_classifier.pkl` | `MLLogClassifier.train()` | Random Forest log classifier |
| `anomaly_detector.pkl` | `IsolationForestDetector.fit()` | Isolation Forest anomaly detector |
| `predictive_model.pkl` | `PredictiveMaintenanceModel.train()` | GBM failure predictor |

## Notes

- Models are created automatically the first time training is triggered
- Until models are trained, the system falls back to rule-based / heuristic scoring
- Models can be retrained via the `/api/v1/ml/train/*` endpoints
- Add this directory to `.gitignore` to avoid committing large binary files
